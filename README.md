## About

Bobbing Apples is a basic web based JavaScript game. A game designed to help with the support and development for teaching and learning phonics to children in early years. The game adopts a simple approach with an appealing colour scheme that will allow for the ideal user experience for a young target audience.

The targeted audience will initially be that of a teacher or parent that will use this as a resource for aiding and supporting the learning experience for teaching children to identify real words. Once the adult has chosen the word group that they require, then the intended audience target will change to that of a child of early years age 4-5 who will then proceed to play the game.

Having multiple resources with different styles of gameplay greatly enhances the learning experience and support that a teacher can offer there children. For the child they will benefit from having more variety in terms of the games that they can play. Bobbing Apples gives them the benefits of an easy style of play, that will give them the core basic learning of being able to identify what words are real or fake.

### **Strategy**

**Site Goals**

This project is to come up with an interactive experience to users by firstly designing and then creating a web based game using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The main goals of the game are to provide teachers/parents with a resource that can help them when teaching phonics phase 3 set 6 to 4 and 5 year olds and also importantly to help those children progress by giving them the opportunity to learn new words in a fun and engaging experience.

The game must be easy to navigate and easy for a child to play so that they don't become bored or overwhelmed due to complexity. It must be appealing with the use of easy identifiable objects and bright bold colours. The game should be fully responsive and be playable on all modern devices.

### **Scope**

The main features for the game are to include an easy to follow navigation with a bright colour scheme that will appeal to the younger audience. It will feature an interactive layout that will give the user fun factor whilst also providing an all important learning experience.

**Start**

This is the first part of the game where the user will be informed of how to play the game and will provide them with a button that will start the game. There will also feature an animated bobbing apples object which will clearly show the link between the title and the overall theme of the game. At the footer of the screen will be where the user can contact the developer via a modal form. Next to this link will be an icon of GitHub that will allow the user to go to the developers GitHub repository page.

**Options**

The options layout will keep the same layout as the first but instead of a central start button, the user will be presented with four new buttons to select. They will also have clear and easy to read text that clearly states which phase and set of phonics this game targets. The option buttons will allow the user to select which word groups they would like to play with.

**Gameplay**

The layout for the actual game will change completely. The score for the user to see will be featured at the top right of the page. The object in the centre of the page will have an animated single bobbing apple that will contain the word that the user will read. Depending on the display there will be another two separate objects either underneath or on the side that will be where the user will drag the apple to, depending on whether they believe the answer is correct or wrong. The user at any given time will be able to go back to the main menu where they can choose a different word group. This will be accessible via a button on the top left of the screen.

**Final Score**

The last layout will revert back to the first two layouts (Start & Options) in keeping with an easy design layout, however, the top section text will contain the final score that the user managed to achieve. The middle button will allow the user to play the game again.
